# Date variables can be hard, so we convert them
# into something more useful

# Install a package called lubridate via the
# Packages tab -  should take very little time
library(lubridate)

# Next, import the data from a file. 

# If you encounter an error message, 
# then you must set the Working Directory.
# You could use the Files tab to navigate 
# to the file MonthlyCloses.csv
# and select More > Set working directory

# a format recognisable by R
